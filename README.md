# 100 Days of Code 👩🏻‍💻🎉

I've lost a lot of my enthusiasm for coding recently, and I'm not afraid to admit it. I finished my bootcamp around 15 months ago and I feel like I haven't flourished the way I'd hoped, probably for a lot of reasons. I'm hoping that with a bit of motivation from this challenge, it will kickstart something for me. I'll probably include some design principles in here too because I believe this stuff should be all wrapped up together. I'll start with some basic stuff to get myself warmed up and into the swing of things, but maybe I'll learn a new language or something along the way. 100 days is a long time. As October will happen in this time, it'll be handy to get my second hacktober year in too!

I'll use this repository to store a log of my work, so I can keep track of my progress, and I'll probably tweet about it too [over here](https://twitter.com/ichbinclamp).

Start: Thursday 27th August 2020

_Potential_ end: Saturday 5th December 2020

If you haven't heard of 100 days of code, you can learn about it [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/). Though I'm only going to be following their rules exactly to the tee because I also have a life.
